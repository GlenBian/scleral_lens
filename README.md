## Scleral Contact Lens Fitting
Estimation of radius of curvature of Sclera through Anterior Segment OCT Images

### Authors - Sujeath Pareddy, Darpan Sanghavi, Dhruv Joshi

This project is all about estimation of scleral topography in four directions - nasal, temporal, superior and inferior, using AS-OCT Images taken at the LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. The software is being developed at the Srujana Center for Innovation, LVPEI as a research tool for the Contact Lens Department. 

Our intention is to make a software frontend which would enable clinicians to estimate these values from images quickly. These will then be correlated to fitting parameters in the contant lens.

All code written in python using scientific python packages.
